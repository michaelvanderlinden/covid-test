# covid-test

This is a client-only webapp that processes Lu lab take-home covid test cards. The user applies positive and negative control solutions and testing solution to the card, then takes a picture with their phone.

They upload the picture to the webapp which compares the colors of each sample to the reference swatches printed on the card. In addition to providing preliminary positive or negative results, the app can detect bad lighting, poorly reacting reagants, bad or missing control swatches, etc. The QR code markers orient the image to properly target each color region.

Test version of the webapp is here: https://mvdl.io/covid-test/

Our hardworking biochemists are Lucinda Peng and Emily Jackson-Holmes.
